# mksocfpga
Further development of the Machinekit SocFpga


Update (4-marts-2016)

I have been working on the scripts path months trying to get network access to function on the 4.x kernels.

Having not much success with this I have reverted back to the 3.10-rt-ltsi kernel in the Altera repo, to get on with debugging the hw I/O interface.

Right now there are functioning sd-image gen scripts mainly developed on Debian Stretch that can generate various debian dists (tested with jessie, stretch and sid).

The main script is right now split in 2 versions named after the host they are meant to run on.


Most of the script cofiguration is moved to the main script:

Toolchain, dist, kernel version, sd-imagename 

Kernel (git cloned, or file download & patched, url's)

Networking on the 3.10 jessie beta3 image is ipv4 dhcp plug and play, all you would need to add would be to set your own static custom mac address in u-boot so your dhcp server dosn't keep generating new leases every time you reboot the soc.

Pending MK PR commit now passes all checks and has been through lots of bug fixes and typo corrections. 

Right now I will put focus once again onto the quartus project, to get the data write (read) to function properly.

Beta3 image is online (in my shared Machinekit gdrive folder) and I expect to sneak in a public announcement of the bugfix release later today.

Update(29 feb-2016)

Kernel changed to mainline 4.4.3 with 4.4.3-rt9.patch

Update(19 feb-2016)

Partition layout changed: rootfs -->p3 (this should make downloaded images easiely expandable)

fpga config on boot patched onto u-boot.

Enable uio driver patched onto kernel config.

Kernel changed to mainline 4.4.1-rt with rt ltsi patch 4.4.1-rc6

TODO: fix network ipv4 access (via systemd upgrade...)

u-boot compiles with 4.9 and 5.2 gcc (linaro x86_64 cross + ?)

4.4 kernel builds with gcc 5.2     (linaro x86_64 cross + ?)

rootfs has native armhf gcc 4.9

No manual u-boot env changes needed

SD-Cross-Build scripts split into Debian Jessie and Stretch edition

update(14-feb-2014)

Fully bootable sd-image (MK-Rip-built) (3.10-rt-ltsi kernel from Altera socfpga repo)

Remember usb serial console 115200 8n1 on first boot.

DE0-Nano Quartus project fully functional.

    Initial hal hostmot2 module drivers to be tested with custom uio driver module online:

    
https://github.com/the-snowwhite/machinekit/tree/mksoc/src

Quickstart test quide:

1   mksoc --> mksocfpga   !!!  (use the new  repo)

2. in a new repo folder do: git clone https://github.com/the-snowwhite/mksocfpga.git

3. then create and cd to a different new folder (your work folder).

4.a extract the rootfs sd image into the work folder. links:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwyLvgyVIdi8TkI5NHNBQlhnSms/view?usp=sharing


4.b copy the folder boot_files from repo to work folder (contains valid out_put from quartus ... no need to run quartus makefile)

4.c copy folder hm2reg_uio-module (from SW/MK/kernel-drivers) to work folder.

4.d Note: you will neeed to copy the socfpga_defconfig into the (correct) arm/config folder overwriting the default one to enable uio-driver after the script has cloned the kernel repo on first run(with warnings). (needs patch fix...!)

5. edit this script in your local mksocfpga repo folder:
 https://github.com/the-snowwhite/mksocfpga/blob/master/Scripts/SD-Image-Gen/mksocfpga-debian-jessie-sd-image-gen.sh#L333

as so(near bottom):

    if [ ! -z "$WORK_DIR" ]; then

    build_uboot
    build_kernel

    ##build_rcn_kernel

    ##build_rootfs_into_folder

    #create_image
    #build_rootfs_into_image

    #fetch_extract_rcn_rootfs

    #run_initial_sh


    install_files
    install_uboot

    echo "#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "
    echo "#-------             Image building process complete                       -------- "


keep cd in your work folder and call the script like this:

"your repo folder"/mksocfpga/Scripts/SD-Image-Gen/mksocfpga-debian-jessie-sd-image-gen.sh anything

NOTE:
Remember on your first boot to have yout usbserial terminal connected and press space (or any key) within 3 sek,
then paste 1 and 3 into the console from here:
https://github.com/the-snowwhite/mksocfpga/blob/master/docs/set-uboot-env.md
